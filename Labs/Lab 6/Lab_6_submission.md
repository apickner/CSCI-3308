# ---------------------------------------- Question 1 ---------------------------------------- #

	Tutorial: nothing to do here, just read up on some Postgres topics.
# ---------------------------------------- Question 2 ---------------------------------------- #

	Creating the database and the DBâ€™s individual tables: copy and paste INSERT statements.

	DB Fiddle: use if Postgres is not installed correctly on your system.

- It is correctly set-up on my system

# ---------------------------------------- Question 4 ---------------------------------------- #
**DOES NOT WORK CURRENTLY...**

1. **check!**
~~~sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS universities (
	university_name VARCHAR(45) PRIMARY KEY,
	date_est INT,
	street_address VARCHAR(45),
	student_pop INT,
	acceptance_rate DECIMAL
);
~~~


2.
~~~sql
INSERT INTO universities( university_name,
					  	date_est,
						  street_address,
						  student_pop,
						  acceptance_rate )
VALUES('CU Boulder',
	   1876,
	   '1100 28th St, Boulder, CO 80303',
	   35000,
	   0.8);
~~~

# ---------------------------------------- Question 5 ---------------------------------------- #
	Query Basics

1. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT name,
          major
FROM football_players
ORDER BY major ASC;
~~~

2. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT name,
		  rushing_yards
FROM football_players
WHERE rushing_yards > 70;
~~~

3. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM football_games
WHERE visitor_name = 'Nebraska';
~~~

4. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM football_games
WHERE home_score > visitor_score;
~~~

5. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT visitor_name,
		  game_date
FROM football_games;
~~~

6. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT AVG(home_score)
FROM football_games;
~~~

7. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT major,
		  COUNT(major) AS number_of_players
FROM football_players
GROUP BY major;
~~~

8. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT major,
      	COUNT(major) AS number_of_players
FROM football_players
WHERE major = 'CSCI'  
GROUP BY major;
~~~

# ---------------------------------------- Question 6 ---------------------------------------- #
	Views & Subqueries

1. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_wins
FROM football_games
WHERE home_score > visitor_score;
~~~

2. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_games
FROM football_games;
~~~

3. **check!**

~~~sql
SELECT (
(SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM football_games
 WHERE home_score > visitor_score)::decimal
 /
(SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM football_games)::decimal)
 * 100.0;
~~~

# ---------------------------------------- Question 7 ---------------------------------------- #
	Handling Joins

1. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (football_games JOIN football_players
	 ON football_players.id=ANY(football_games.players))

~~~

2. **check!**
~~~sql
SELECT ((football_players.rushing_yards)::decimal / (COUNT(*))::decimal)
FROM (football_games JOIN football_players ON football_players.id=ANY(football_games.players))
